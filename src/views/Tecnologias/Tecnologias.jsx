                <p>It’s entirely possible to learn the ways of 3D modelling software at home. Online courses are a great way to start, and often guide you through the entire process until you’re comfortable with the software. It’s an easy way to have someone show you the ropes at any time and place.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We’ve outlined some of our highly-rated courses that will set you up for success within 3D modelling:</p>
                <p>Once you’re comfortable with the fundamentals of 3D modelling, you’ll be able to practice and hone your skills. You’ll be creating games and designing buildings in no time!&nbsp;</p>
                <h4><strong>How to make your 3D model&nbsp;</strong></h4>
                <p>What your first 3D project will depend greatly on where you’re learning and what you’re learning. However, it’s always a good idea to start simple. Pick up the basics and become comfortable with the software you’re using. You’ll eventually pick up the pace and be creating fully-fledged 3D models of anything your heart desires.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Since a lot of online courses will walk you through the process of making something, you’ll likely start with their suggestion. You could also play around with the software and see if you can make a personal project once you know the basics.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In our Introduction<a href="/courses/introduction-to-3d-modeling"> to 3D modelling</a> course, you’ll learn the basics of 3D modelling and also get the chance to make your very own 3D model project.</p>
                <h4><strong>Is 3D modelling worth learning?</strong></h4>
                <p>The answer to this is simple &#8211; absolutely! The industry is incredibly fast-paced, with lots of room for creativity and job opportunities. Whether you’re eager to find a new hobby or you’re trying to tap into a fun techy career, 3D modelling is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The 3D space is full to the brim with new opportunities. Take the metaverse, for example, a fully three-dimensional environment taking the world by storm. The 3D mapping and modelling market is even projected to <a href="https://www.imarcgroup.com/3d-mapping-modeling-market">grow by 17.2%</a> between 2022-2027.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>With the 3D modelling space being relevant in so many industries and increasing in popularity with increased technological advancements, it’s a great area to work in. Some of the roles you could land yourself with 3D modelling skills include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
